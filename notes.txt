Server side settings
-------------------
-->to create package.json --> 'npm init -y' --> edit that file and change main to 'server.js'
--> install some dependencies like express, bcryptjs, config, mongoose, nodemon, concurrently( npm i -D nodemon --> for dev dependencies)


nodemon
-------
--> normally if we make any changes to html or any code.. we have to restart our server... if we use Nodemon.. it will refersh automatically

concurrently
-------------
--> we have to run node server and react simultaneously for that we need concurrently
